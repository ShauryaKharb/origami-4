                    <li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years. The first recordings of this date back to Mesopotamis, modern Iraq, in 3000bc.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>

                    <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</li>
                    <li>A teddy has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of a school project.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, in Germany in the same year, the Steiff family developed a silk-like fabric bear, based on zoo animals. They caused a sensation at a toy fair and were snapped up by an American buyer.</li>
                    <li>They aren’t just for children – 40% of teddy sales are for adults, and a quarter of us still has our childhood companion.</li>

                    <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
                    <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
                    <li>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools.</li>
                    <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
